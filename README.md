Bullet Points


1.My website is a library management system through my website so a user can pick up and bring or return books.

2.In order to get a book, a user must first register and then login. After logging in, select the category of the book to be taken. There are several types of books from the category. You can borrow any book from there. You will have to pay a certain amount of time while borrowing.

3.In the website we have all books, add books, borrow books, login page if the user does not register then he can not borrow books.

4.all books If you go here, first you have to register and login, then to see all the books, if you go to the all box, the user will see the update button.

5.If the user goes to the category of the book, he will get the details button, if he clicks on the details button, he will get the big button, if he enlarges, he will have to give the date of the bro button, the date on which he will back the book. won't show
